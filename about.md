I’m a software engineer focused on designing and evolving
systems that survive real-world complexity.

I care about:
- long-term maintainability over cleverness
- architecture as a series of trade-offs, not diagrams
- teams and systems growing together

This blog is a place to think in public —
mostly about architecture, scalability, and engineering leadership.
